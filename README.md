# simple-pixels

Just a small personal project of mine.
This may not be the most efficient rendering method, but it should fit for an emulator or a simple game.

## Goals

* Simplicity.
* Minimal dependencies.
* Safety.

This crate is built on [`miniquad`](https://crates.io/crates/miniquad). It should support all platforms that `miniquad` supports.
