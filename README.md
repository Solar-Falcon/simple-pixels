# simple-pixels

Just a small personal project of mine.
This may not be the most efficient rendering method, but it should fit for an emulator or a simple game.

## Goals

* Simplicity.
* Minimal dependencies.

## TODOs

* Documentation. While the structure of the crate is pretty straightforward, it's always good to have docs.
* Examples.
* Actually finish this README.
